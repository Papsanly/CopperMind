# CopperMind

CopperMind is a Rust-based implementation of a perceptron neural network, designed with a primary focus on deepening
understanding of both neural networks and the Rust programming language. This project aims to provide a comprehensive
learning experience by building a neural network from the ground up, without relying on external libraries or
frameworks, while simultaneously exploring the intricacies of Rust's syntax and features.

## Features

- Implementation of the perceptron neural network algorithm.
- todo!()

## Installation

To use CopperMind in your project, follow these steps:

1. Install Rust programming language and Cargo package manager. Visit [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org) for
   installation instructions.

2. Add CopperMind as a dependency in your Cargo.toml file:

```toml
[dependencies]
coppermind = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example demonstrating how to use CopperMind:

```rust
use coppermind::Perceptron;

fn main() {
    todo!();
}
```
